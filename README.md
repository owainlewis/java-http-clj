## Intro

The [java.net.http.HttpClient](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/package-summary.html) was added in Java 11. It can be used to request HTTP resources over the network.

It supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, synchronous and asynchronous programming models, handles request and response bodies as reactive-streams, and follows the familiar builder pattern.

This library exposes the native java HTTP client via Clojure and supports both sync and async requests.

## Getting started

In order to use this library you will need to be running Java 11+. 

Add the library to your project:

```
[com.owainlewis/java-http-clj "0.3.0"]
```

You can import the library into your projects as follows:

```clojure
(ns myns
  (:require [java-http-clj.core :as http]))
```

## Basic Usage

Requests work exactly as you'd expect.

```clojure
;; Make a simple request and return the HTTP status
(-> (http/get "http://owainlewis.com") :status)

;; Passing in other request options
(http/get "https://www.google.com"
  {:headers {"Accept" "application/json" "Accept-Encoding" ["gzip" "deflate"]}
   :timeout 2000})
```

Alternatively you can construct a `raw` request yourself.

Raw requests are created as follows

```clojure
(http/request {:method :get :url "http://ip.jsontest.com/"})
```

### Query Parameters

You can add query parameters to your request using the following form:

```clojure
(http/get "https://postman-echo.com/get" {:query-parameters {:foo "bar"}})
```

### Async Requests

There are async implementations of all core HTTP methods.

When using the async client, you can provide an optional callback and an optional error handler.

```clojure
;; With callback
(http/async-get "https://github.com"
  (fn [r] (println (:status r))))

;; With callback and error handler
(http/async-get "https://github.com"
  (fn [r] (println (:status r)))
  (fn [e] (println e)))
```
